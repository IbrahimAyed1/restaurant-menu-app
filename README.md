1-Steps To Get Environments & Softwares:
1-Use a terminal
You'll be doing these exercises using a Unix-style terminal on your computer. If you are using a Mac or Linux system, your regular terminal program will do just fine.
On Windows, we recommend using the Git Bash terminal that comes with the Git software.
If you don't already have Git installed, 
===>download Git from: git-scm.com.


2-Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.
===>NOTE: Ubuntu users: If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu Software Center instead. Due 		to a reported bug, installing VirtualBox from the site may uninstall other software you need.
	Windows users: The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be 		sure to allow this.


3-Download the VM configuration :
you can use Github to fork and clone the repository https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.

4- Run your application : # python project.py

5-Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:9090 locally

6- You can see your JSON data notation 
	through here -> 'http://localhost:9090/restaurants/put_here_restaurant_id/menu/JSON/'
